## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pastel lavender (#D0BFFF), chosen to evoke feelings of love, peace, and creativity.
- Background color: Light pastel grey (#F0F0F5), same hue as primary, softly desaturated for a light scheme.
- Accent color: Soft rose (#FFC8DD), an analogous color to the primary, to create a contrast and emphasize interaction.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter text elements, to enhance the artistic and stylish feel. 'Alegreya' (serif) will be used for the longer love story slider since it has higher legibility.
- Use delicate, hand-drawn icons for interactive elements.
- The layout will feature a clean and minimalist design, ensuring readability and focus on content.
- Subtle fade-in and slide animations will be used throughout the site to create a smooth user experience.  Confetti effect on positive affirmation.
